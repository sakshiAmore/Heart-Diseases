ðŸ“˜ Overview
The Heart Diseases Dataset contains medical information from patients and is intended for the study and prediction of heart-related conditions. Each record represents a patient and includes features that are clinically relevant to cardiovascular health. This dataset is widely used in machine learning and statistical modeling to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.
